# ftc_app

This is the robot control application for the Ronald Reagan Robotics FTC team

All code will be versioned and split into three branches Master (Stable), Testing, and Development

Workflow will go like this, all programmers who are a part of the organisation will clone the development repository and work out of that. As you make commits and push to the development repo, major version numbers will be pulled over into testing to be tested on the robot or test chasis out of competition. After both programmers and drivers and satisfied with the test program it will be moved over into the master/stable branch which is what will be used for competitions.
